i uploaded a set of files. disregard matcher.py which i uploaded by mistake - grokmatcher2.py is the current version. There are three python programs. 1: processor.py which processes bank statements, cash payments, and mobile payments (including fees), assigns voucher ids and generates several files for further processing (including assigning account information). is is based on bank.csv, mp.csv and cash.csv plus grokcreditors.json 2: docprocessor.py which processes a folder of documents and extracts information that matches patterns dates, amounts (minus those that are found to be part of a date)  and other text (minus those that are found to be a date or an amount) 3: grokmatcher2.py which contains a small ui to match the bank statements (in bank_kred.csv) to vouchers by the voucher id. The latter also uses grokcreditors.json and can be run multiple times since it maintains its state in matchinfo.json. Analyse and confirm
